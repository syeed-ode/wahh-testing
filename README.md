# wahh-testing

This is some code from reviewing the Web Application Hackers Handbook. This initial code hits a canned URL searching for a range of pages numbers, collecting the response and length of data. It can be augemented to peform mapping of an attack surface. 

Wrapping wget within a bash or python call can achieve the same goal. The point is to automate surface/application mapping.
